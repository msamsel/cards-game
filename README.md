## Game rules:

- Player has one card at a time
- There are two buttons that the player uses to decide whether the next card number will be higher or lower 
- Once the player chooses one of the options, he/she gets 0.1 point for the correct answer, and a new dice/card is shown
- There should be 30 rounds of the game

## Requirements:

- The card/dice should be represented by a picture
- History of all the rounds and results has to be created and shown
- The number of remaining rounds, and the sum of points have to be visible
- Closing the app saves the current game
- If the game is resumed, the player gets a question “Reload the previous game?”
- If the player chooses “YES”, previously saved game is reloaded
- If the player chooses “NO”, a new game starts
